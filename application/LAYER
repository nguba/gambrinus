Files in this project belong to the Application Layer

This layer defines the jobs the software is supposed to do and directs the
expressive domain objects to work out problems.  The tasks this layer is
responsible for are meaningful to the business or necessary for interaction
with the the application layers of other systems.

This layer is kept thin.

It does not contain business rules or knowledge, but only coordinates tasks and
delegates work to collaborations of domain objects in the next layers down.

It does not have state reflecting the business situation, but it can have state
that reflects the progress of a task for the suer or the program.
